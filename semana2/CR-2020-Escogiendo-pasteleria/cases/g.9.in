25
Farewell
To all the earthly remains
No burdens
No further debts to be paid
Atlas
Can rest his weary bones
The weight of the world
All falls away
In time
Goodbye
To all the plans that we made
No contracts
I’m free to do as I may
No hunger
No sleep except to dream
Mild and warm
Safe from all harm
Calm
Good riddance
To all the thieves
To all the fools that stifled me
They’ve come and gone
And passed me by
Good riddance
To all
